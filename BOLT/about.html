			<h1>Noise treatment</h1>
			<img src="photos/noise.jfif" alt="Cardio Equipment" class="round">
			<p> Noise therapy, also known as sound therapy or sound healing, is a holistic approach that uses various sounds to improve mental health and well-being. This therapy can involve listening to specific types of music, nature sounds, white noise, or even rhythmic drumming. The goal of noise therapy is to create a calming and relaxing environment, which can help reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia. Some studies suggest that noise therapy can also improve focus, enhance mood, and promote a sense of inner peace. It is often used as a complementary treatment alongside other therapies for mental health conditions.</p>

			<h1>Personal Therapist</h1>
			<img src="photos/therapist.jpg" alt="Personal Training" class="round" style="height: 200px; width: 300px;">
			<p>Therapists play a crucial role in mental health by providing professional guidance and support to individuals experiencing emotional or psychological difficulties. They are trained to help people explore their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, and to develop coping strategies and solutions to manage their challenges. Therapists use various therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, and counseling, tailored to the specific needs of their clients. Their role is to create a safe and nonjudgmental space for clients to express themselves, gain insights into their problems, and work towards positive changes in their lives. Therapists also provide education about mental health issues and can collaborate with other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care for their clients.</p>
